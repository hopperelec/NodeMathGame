This is a game similar to [Beltmatic](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2674590/Beltmatic/),
where you build factories to perform math and achieve higher numbers,
and [Masterplan Tycoon](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1644500/Masterplan_Tycoon/),
where you build factories by connecting nodes.

If you haven't seen Masterplan Tycoon before, it uses a similar node system to software like Blender, Davinci Resolve Fusion and ComfyUI.
In this game, you buy nodes using points and connect them to perform math. You start with a "1" node, which outputs 1 every second, and a "Sell" node, which converts numbers into points.

**This game is mostly functioning as a proof of concept for the time being.
The name isn't even finalized yet. Don't expect very thrilling gameplay!**
